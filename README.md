- ⚡ Fun fact: There is a fun fact about my life. I tried many things in life and got succeed in 90% of them till I was in school but as soon as I get into the college I lost myself in the race of chasing validation, getting fit in groups that were not even meant for me and I forgot about what I am really passionate about - coding , studying, developing and learning new skills , working on myself to have a personality. I regained my sense of analysing and thinking back in December 2023, as I completed my first year and realized how much time I lost by just doing things that weren't even meant for me. I still sometimes face existential issues, as I see people enjoying their life with their friends but then I remind myself that I enjoy being alone.** Solitude is the key to my happy life**
